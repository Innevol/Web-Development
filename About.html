This is the main website where you can book your stay to a hotel in Hawaii. You are
</br>given the ability to research Hawaii's main website from the information link
</br>provided in the navigation bar. You can choose between three different rooms
</br>ranging from single, double, queen, and king sizes. One person has the ability to 
</br>order up to 3 rooms, and must be 18 and older. When you enter your information
</br>and hit confirm, you are sent to a confirmation page where you are given a unique
</br>confirmation number and may review your information. Update and cancel options
</br>are given to allow you to cancel your reservation, and update your information.
</br>From there, you can sit back, relax, and pack for your vacation!
