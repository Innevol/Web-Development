<h4>
<u>Background and Layout</u>
</h4>
<p>
A test was made with the two testers to see the amount of interference between 
the focus of the text and forms with the background active. The background images
were properly scaled and created no interference between the readability of the text
and forms on each page.
</br>
<b>Feedback:</b>Provided a touch of complexity to the overall simple UI design.
</br>
<b>Results:</b>This passes the test.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
<u>Form</u>
</h4>
<p>
This test had the two testers check if the forms contained what was necessary for the
goal of the website. They were to check for proper label of each and every form, as well
as a clear, distinct description for update and cancel pages.
</br>
<b>Feedback:</b>The forms had the necessary labels to them and descriptions were
detailed enough without having to be too long.
</br>
<b>Results:</b>This passes the test.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
<u>Text</u>
</h4>
<p>
A test was made with the two testers to see the amount of interference between 
the focus of the text and forms with the background active. The text had a transparent
black background that gave the text a decent enough contrast from the complex background
images and make readability better.
</br>
<b>Feedback:</b>Provided abstraction of the text from the complex background images.
</br>
<b>Results:</b>This passes the test.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
<u>Links/Hyperlinks</u>
</h4>
<p>
A test was made with the two testers to see the usage and purpose of the links/hyperlinks
that are embedded into the navigation pane of the webage, as well as the submit input
type buttons for the forms. They also ensured that it had proper labels for the destination
it leads to.
</br>
<b>Feedback:</b>The labels for each link made sense and directed you to where you
assumed it would take you. The submit buttons also led to the correct pages where the
right sequence of information is displayed.
</br>
<b>Results:</b>This passes the test.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
<u>Compatibility</u>
</h4>
<p>
A test was made with the two testers to see the different browsers that this would properly
run on. Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer were able to properly run the files the way they
needed to be display.
</br>
<b>Feedback:</b>Everything ran fine and looked identical across all the browser screens.
</br>
<b>Results:</b>This passes the test.
